Unsupervised Machine Learning Project
Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) to explore datasets, identify patterns, and gain insights without relying on labeled data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised ML is used when we donâ€™t know the outcomes beforehand, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis (EDA), anomaly detection, and clustering.

Objective

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in datasets.

Understand underlying structures in data without labels.

Showcase the power of unsupervised techniques for data exploration.

Methodology

Data Loading & Cleaning

Read datasets and handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, variance).

Distribution plots, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

Correlation analysis to detect relationships between features.

Unsupervised ML Techniques (Optional)

Clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical clustering to detect natural groupings.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA or t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data.

Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns in data points.

Insights & Visualizations

Use plots to highlight patterns and trends in the dataset.

Generate interactive visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
